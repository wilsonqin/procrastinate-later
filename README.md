Procrastinate Later

A Chrome extension to organize links to pages/articles/videos that you want to check out later, so as not to distract you now.

It works by adding both contextual actions to track links for later while browsing, and also providing a 'feed' view of all tracked links for later delayed procrastination sessions.
